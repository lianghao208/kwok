# Running `kwok` out of cluster

{{< hint "info" >}}

This document walks you through how to run `kwok` out of cluster for a Kubernetes cluster.

{{< /hint >}}

## Prerequisites

Firstly, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kwok` command-line tool must be available in your `PATH`.

## Install `kwok`

[Install `kwok`][install] in your environment.

## Running

Next, you can run `kwok` out of cluster by using the `--kubeconfig` flag.

```bash
kwok \
  --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config \
  --manage-all-nodes=false \
  --manage-nodes-with-annotation-selector=kwok.x-k8s.io/node=fake \
  --manage-nodes-with-label-selector= \
  --disregard-status-with-annotation-selector=kwok.x-k8s.io/status=custom \
  --disregard-status-with-label-selector= \
  --cidr=10.0.0.1/24 \
  --node-ip=10.0.0.1
```

Finally, you can see the `kwok` is running out of cluster for the Kubernetes cluster.

## Next steps

Now, you can use `kwok` to [manage nodes and pods] in the Kubernetes cluster.
